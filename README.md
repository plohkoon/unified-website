### Description

This is the unification point, alll web apps that I make will have a route here. I will eventually have a react applet that consumes the GitHub API and links to the various projects

### How-to

On first install run "npm install" and then "npm run rebuild" to get dependencies all right and proper and properly setup for Electron

To run a test version of the program run "npm start" in admin CMD prompt

To package the software run "npm run make-app"
